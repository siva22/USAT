well, it's after a thorough (rather long) research, i have finalized on this mobile. 
my criteria: 2 gb ram (to accommodate decent apps as well as good response), good battery, sleek in design and handling as well as top notch music.
i have figured out below devices for my parameters:
2 gb ram : lenovo a6000 plus / yu yuphoria 
good battery : yu phoria
sleek design : lenovo a6000 plus
good music : lenovo a6000 plus
while the other factors on lenovo was promising, its ui ( i really dont like vibe ui and its bloatware) and apprehensions on heating issues, i wished redmi 1s could have 2 gb ram (i own a redmi 1s as well :)). well, gods have answered me :)
redmi 2 prime turned out be a perfect answer for all of my above parameters.
after 3 days of usage, below are my observations :
1. display - 10/10
2. touch response - 10/10
3. ui - 9/10
4. music - 10/10
5. camera - 7/10
6. speed - 9/10
7. loud speakers - 9/10
8. wifi signal strength - 6/10
9. battery back up - 9/10
10. performance - 9/10
though most of it is highly appreciable, one downpoint i see is weak wifi signal. keeping both redmi 1s and redmi 2 prime side by side, i could see 1 bar less on redmi 2 prime. otherwise, no qualms. hope any software upgrade would resovle this weak wifi issue
i have one redmi 2 and recently purchased redmi 2 prime. both are awesome from any others mobile on this range. prime is a best budgeted smartphone one can have in this time (august-2015) 2gb ram - 16gb internal memory.. :) if you are going for this phone, i'd say you are a smart buyer. if someone is making time for writing a good review, it means the phone has got some potential. amazing camera quality, extremely light weighted, good design, easy to carry. 2 gb ram, it is like a cherry on the cake. it will never freeze. amazing music quality, display and brightness is also good. don't be worried about the issues because of the mi company's name. overall an amazing experience.
if there'd have been a 6th start for this, i'd have given it. hope this review is helpful to the next buyer. happy time with mi :)
1)it's price tag> no other phone can match redmi 2 prime..
2)camera>night shooting is superb....
3)a little heating while using high definition games..
4)battery backup is decent..
5)miui is so much customized that every day u will feel like having a new set of configurations.. 
6)best think is 4.7 inch> perfect for single hand use n indian sized hands..
came with excellent packaging thanks to flipkart... built quality is premium of this device, excellent call quality.. dual sim 4g,3g works topnotch. camera quality is excellent if you know how to take pictures :) playing games is a bliss..i have installed trine2 , leo's fortune, yurei ninja, monument valley,asphalt8, fruit attacks,angry birds 2, plants vs zombies 2 .. thanks to 2gb ram and 16gb rom.. everything is smooth no lags. battery is a plus point, with quick charging tech i can charge 20% to 60% in just half hour..ofcourse i am using my own asus 2amp adapter. led notifications are cool, can change different colors, got latest miui update of 625mb which is super stable.. this mobile is practically everything that i want !
the phone is good in terms of configuration like 2 gb ram and 16gb internal memory but i find the speaker is of inferior quality, both hearing and loudspeaker needs improvement. the phone has no heating problem after the upgrade. applications runs like anything and touch is excellent.
i would request flipkart / xiaomi to look into this so that the people who are buying don't face this problem. also please change the current speakers so that people already bought this dont feel betrayed. this is my 2nd mi phone and i know this is not in mi culture to supply substandard products. how come made in india sets have problem of this sort when made in china sets were excellent, such things defeats our pms vision of make in india as well. i hope this would be taken up at highest level of quality checks and get the same rectified by recalling faulty handsets.
